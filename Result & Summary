Summary
Project Objective:
This project aimed to predict hotel booking cancellations using various machine learning models to aid hotel management in reducing cancellations and enhancing booking strategies.

Data Overview:
The dataset contained 119,390 rows and 32 features, covering customer demographics, booking details, and stay information. Key preprocessing steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and creating new features such as 'stay' (sum of weekend and week nights stayed).

Conclusion
Model Evaluation:
We evaluated several models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, SGD, and Naive Bayes. These models were assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Best Performing Model: The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 0.87, along with strong performance metrics across precision (0.84), recall (0.75), and F1-score (0.79).
Feature Importance: Analysis revealed that 'lead_time' and 'adr' (average daily rate) were significant predictors of cancellations, highlighting the importance of early bookings and room pricing strategies.
Insights and Recommendations:

Key Insights: 'Lead_time' and 'adr' were pivotal in predicting cancellations. High-lead-time bookings and room pricing emerged as critical factors.
Recommendations: It is advisable for hotel management to focus on strategies to minimize cancellations for high-lead-time bookings and explore dynamic pricing models to optimize room rates.
Limitations and Future Work:
This study faced limitations due to data availability and model selection. Future research could expand the dataset, include additional features like weather conditions and local events, and explore advanced deep learning models to further enhance prediction accuracy.
